Vehicle Tracking System

An android app developed particularly for the student of Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology. this help to keep track of the varsity bus so that all the students who are coming from city can keep track of the bus and be on the bus on time.

This is a two part app. Current Location part will be installed in the vehicle and the tracking will be installed on the client side.

No requirement for separate GPS device in the vehicle.

Your smartphone will act as a mobile GPS device once the app is installed.

And for the Current Location part the app must be connected with a database where the location will be stored and from where it will be fetched from. I used Firebase database for my side.
